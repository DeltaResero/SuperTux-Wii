-Penny has been captured!

	Tux and Penny were enjoying a peaceful
	picnic, when the evil Nolok appeared!

	In a flash, Tux was knocked out. When
	he awoke, Penny was gone! A note left
	behind taunted him: "I've taken Penny
	to my fortress. You'll never see her
	again! -Nolok"

	Determined, Tux spotted the fortress in
	the distance and set off to save her.
